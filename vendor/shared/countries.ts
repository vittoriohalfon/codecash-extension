 * Geo targeting vocabulary — the ONE shared list of servable countries (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2). Like the
 * stack taxonomy in targeting.ts, this is a CLOSED allowlist so the three consumers stay provably
 * consistent:
 *   - the advertiser UI renders the searchable country multi-select FROM this list;
 *   - the write path (advertiser bid / dashboard / admin) validates `targeting.countries` against it;
 *   - the serving API matches a creative's country list against the viewer's resolved country.
 *
 * Country here is RESOLVED SERVER-SIDE from the request (CloudFront `CloudFront-Viewer-Country`, an
 * uppercase alpha-2) — never sent by the client — so it can't be spoofed to claim a paid geo. Codes
 * are the de-facto ISO alpha-2 set the CDN emits; we keep names only for display. See lib/geo.ts for
 * resolution and targeting.ts `matchesGeo` for the match.
